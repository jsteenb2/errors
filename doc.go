// package errors makes error handling more powerful and expressive
// while working alongside the std lib errors. This pkg is largely
// inspired by the [upspin project's error handling](https://github.com/upspin/upspin/blame/master/errors/errors.go)
// and github.com/pkg/errors. It also adds a few lessons learned
// from creating a module like this a number of times across numerous
// projects.
